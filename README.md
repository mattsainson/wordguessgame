# wordguessgame

This project is a food themed word guessing game. You start by clicking the green button or typing return.
The game displays boxes for each letter of the word with an asterisk as a placeholder.
Type a letter to guess a letter. You get ten chances to get all the letters of the word.
If you get all the letters of the word, you win. Othewise you lose. Either way, the word is shown with an image of the word.
The current version supports 5 different words.

This project was largely an exercise in Javascript by using objects in code, manipulating the DOM, and handling events.
However, it also includes presentation management using Bootstrap.

Just clone the repository to start, and open index.html in your browser.
